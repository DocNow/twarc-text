# twarc-text

This module extends [twarc] to allow you to print out tweets as text for easy
testing on the command line. Maybe it's useful for spot checking files you've
collected, or your search queries. It's really just a gimmick :) Send a PR to
make it better!

## Install

    pip install twarc-text

## Use

If you've got a file of tweets that you've previously collected you can print
them out:

    twarc2 text tweets.jsonl

Also you can pipe directly, for example displaying the sample stream:

    twarc2 sample | twarc2 text
